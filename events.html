      <h2>Picking the Events</h2>
      
       <div id="events"><p>Harlem Week 2018 is highlighting the accomplishments and contributions of women and the LGBTQ community from both Harlem and the broader world with the theme Women Transforming Our World: Past, Present and Future, along with subtheme The Community Within the Community: Saluting the LGBTQ Community. We wanted to take the time to acknowledge the community that has been here for decades and honor them for their contributions, said Vice President of the Harlem Chamber of Commerce Voza Rivers. For too long we have overlooked or ignored their presence, and it’s time to change that.<br><br>Harlem has a storied history of both prominent, pioneering women and a vibrant LGBTQ community. During the Harlem Renaissance, the neighborhood attracted prominent professionals such as Eunice Carter and Madam C.J. Walker. Jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams performed some of her greatest works in the neighborhood, and the anthropologist Zora Neal Hurston conducted some of her greatest research on Harlem’s streets. The committee felt that that the national moment demanded an emphasis on issues of gender and sexuality. Female activism and political engagement has been a widely observed since the 2016 presidential election. Record numbers of women have registered to run for office across the country, and many continue dominating the political landscape, such as Public Advocate Letitia James, Assemblywoman Inez Dickens and Congresswoman Yvette Clarke.</p>
