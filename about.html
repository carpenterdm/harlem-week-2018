      <div class= "history">
       <p>In the early 19th century, many African Americans moved from their residences in the South, to more industrial, urban areas in the north. One of the factors contributing to the rise of the Harlem Renaissance was the great migration of African-Americans to northern cities (such as New York City, Chicago, and Washington, D.C.) between 1919 and 1926. This was known as the Great Migration, when African Americans relocated to such areas in order to seek out jobs, and overall, better ways of life. The Great Migration helped to spark a cultural renewal for these people in New York City. Black musicians, writers, actors, and artists all reflected this renewal of culture, and celebrated it through their many works. Names such as Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, and Langston Hughes, helped shape both a new African American culture and identity. This movement became known as the Harlem Renaissance, not only became an important part of African American history, but also in the history of the United States.</p></div>
      <div class="aboutharlem"><h2>HARLEM WEEK is all about tradition!</h2></div>
      <div class= "tradition"><p>Harlem Week is a neighborhood tradition dating back to 1974. That year, a tribute to Harlem residents who stayed in the neighborhood through tough times was organized and called Harlem Day. As part of the inaugural Harlem Day, Seventh Avenue was renamed Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard to honor the long-time Harlem congressman and minister. The event was a huge hit and inspired organizers to add more programs in the years following.While the event has grown from a one-day celebration to an month-long festival, the core purpose remains the same. Harlem week is a celebration of what makes the neighborhood unique and is intended to promote Harlem's rich historic, cultural, artistic and religious traditions.</p></div>

         <p>The Apollo Theater was constructed on 125th Street in Harlem, New York. It was originally Hurtig and Seamon's New Burlesque Theatre, and African American admissions were not permitted. It originally featured burlesque, however, the city’s mayor at the time, Fiorello La Guardia, did not like burlesque, and campaigned about it. So in January, 1934, African Americans began to perform, and the attention shifted from Burlesque, to the new celebration of Black culture in New York City.  Initial African American performances featured Ralph Cooper, Sr. Benny Carter, and "16 Gorgeous Hotsteppers". From then on, the Apollo Theater became a place to celebrate African American performers, and featured some well-known names, such as Ella Fitzgerald. This venue helped many other famous black performers start their careers later on, such as James Brown, Stevie Wonder, and even Michael Jackson. "….the Apollo probably exerted a greater influence upon popular culture than any other entertainment venue in the world. For blacks it was the most important cultural institution–not just the greatest black theatre, but a special place to come of age emotionally, professionally, socially, and politically. Ted Fox, “Showtime at the Apollo” The Apollo grew to prominence during the Harlem Renaissance of the pre World-War II years. In 1934, it introduced its regular Amateur Night shows hosted by Ralph Cooper. Deeming itself as a “place where stars are born and legends are made,” the Apollo became famous for launching the careers of artists such as Billie Holiday, Diana Ross & The Supremes, Gladys Knight & the Pips, The Jackson 5, Patti LaBelle, Marvin Gaye, Luther Vandross, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Ben E. King, Mariah Carey, The Isley Brothers, Lauryn Hill, and Sarah Vaughan.  The Apollo also featured performances of old- time vaudeville favorites like Tim Moore, Stepin Fetchit, Dewey “Pigmeat” Markham, Clinton “Dusty” Fletcher, John “Spider Bruce” Mason and Johnny Lee, as well as younger comics like Godfrey Cambridge.</p> <p><strong>To learn more about the historical Apollo Theater </strong><a href="https://historyoftheharlemrenaissance.weebly.com/the-apollo-theatre.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Click here</a></p>
