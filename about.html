    <div class= bio><p>Donna Marie Bey was born in Harlem and has lived in that community for most of her life. Following the Civil War, poor Jews and poor Italians were the predominant demographics in Harlem. African-American residents began to arrive in large numbers in 1905 as part of the Great Migration. In the 1920s and 1930s, Central and West Harlem were the focus of the "Harlem Renaissance", an outpouring of artistic work without precedent in the American-black community.</p></div>

        <div class=aboutharlem><h2>HARLEM WEEK promotes and celebrates the past, present, and future of Harlem!</h2> 
      <p>Harlem Week is a neighborhood tradition dating back to 1974. That year, a tribute to Harlem residents who stayed in the neighborhood through tough times was organized and called Harlem Day. As part of the inaugural Harlem Day, Seventh Avenue was renamed Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard to honor the long-time Harlem congressman and minister. The event was a huge hit and inspired organizers to add more programs in the years following.While the event has grown from a one-day celebration to an month-long festival, the core purpose remains the same. Harlem week is a celebration of what makes the neighborhood unique and is intended to promote Harlem's rich historic, cultural, artistic and religious traditions.</p></div>
